### 💡 Pro Tips for a Smooth Demo
1.  **Open 3 Browser Windows (or Tabs in Incognito):**
    *   Window A: **Patient Login**
    *   Window B: **Doctor Login**
    *   Window C: **Pharmacist Login**
    *   *This stops you from logging in/out constantly.*
2.  **Reset Data:** If you do a "dry run" before the meeting, use a new appointment slot for the real demo so existing data doesn't confuse you.
